Overview
This is the Poznañ University of Technology project. We decided to make calculator, it is also called calculating machine. It's a small electronic&mechanical device that performs calculations, requiring manual action for each individual opertion.

Description
This project consists of:
STM32F407VG microcontroller,
HD44780 display,
Membrane 4x4 Matrix Array keyboard

The heart of this device is microcontroller STM32F4 Discovery. We use LCD HD44780 to display numbers and everything else. To enter numbers we use 2 membrane keypads. All these things form the whole and are enclosed in a printed 3D cover.


Tools - jakie narzêdzie zosta³y u¿yte - wersje itp. Jeœli u¿ywany jest sterownik (VPC) to tutaj podaæ jaki, sk¹d pobraæ. Jaki jêzyk.

How to run
You should upload the program to the STM32 board eg in Coocox.

How to compile
There are no any special things to do. Just copy the project.

Future improvements
Nothing, there is no any bugs.
